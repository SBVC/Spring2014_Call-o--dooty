You wake up slowly with waves crashing over your body. You don't know where you are
or how you got there. You get up and look around.

(blah blah code programming c++)

Look to the left: You see a figure washed up not too far away from you
Look to the right: To the right you see fragments of wood from a wreckage and bones scattered in the sand.

What do you do?
Press l to go to the left
Press r to go to the right

Go to the right: You examine the bones. It looks like they're some kind of animal bones. Something has recently eaten all of the meat off of them. Nearby you spot a
piece of paper. You pick it up and read it:
    MISSING: Reward $10,000 Blonde, green eyes, 6 feet one inches

Go to the left: You approach the figure. It is a young man in fine clothes that have been ruined in the wreckage. He is lying face-down in the sand.
        What do you do?
       
        Search his body.
    The man appears to be dead. You find a folded up piece of paper and a small pouch in his pocket.
       
    You read the paper:
        There is blood on your hands, that blood will never wash away
